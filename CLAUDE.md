## Strict Rules

### Pull Requests

- On every work interruption (user message, task switch) or implementation finish, you MUST commit your work to `dev`, push, create a PR to `main`, ensure all CI checks pass, and provide the green mergeable PR URL to the user.
- Never provide a PR URL that has failing checks or merge conflicts.
- After creating a PR, monitor the CI pipeline status. If checks fail, fix the issues, push fixes, and only then share the final green PR URL.
